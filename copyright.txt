1) The package provides you with a code that solves the 
equations of motion of fluid dynamics numerically, i.e., the conservation
equations for energy-momentum and net baryon number. 
You can choose your own equation of state (EoS),
two sample EoS are included.

2) Furthermore, a code that calculates the hadron distributions
and generates a particle table according to the OSCAR Standard
Output Format ('Final Particle File Format - OSC1997A') is
included.

For more information on OSCAR see

-------------------

We provide this code to enable interested colleagues to
investigate fluid-dynamical behavior in high-energy nuclear
collisions. In particular, the dependence of
 (i)   time-scales for cooling/hadronization and expansion,
 (ii)  the collective flow velocity, 
 (iii) average pt of emitted hadrons
etc. on initial conditions and the EoS may be interesting.
Of course, you are free to study your favorite topics.

Note, however, that code development, testing, debugging and
documentation requires a substantial amount of time. We therefore
kindly request giving proper credit to the authors.

* The specific implementation of the RHLLE algorithm as included in
this package has been published in [1]. In that reference, you can
also find comparisons to other algorithms for numerical fluid dynamics
and analytical solutions, as well as a more detailed discussion of
technical and numerical 'details'.

* The treatment of non-zero net baryon number, and the EoS that
includes the whole variety of hadronic states, have been introduced
in ref. [2]. (However, the sample EoS included in this package is
independent of net baryon density, unlike that employed in [2]).
You can also find discussions of initial conditions, hypersurfaces,
and hadron pt spectra in [2].

* Matching fully relativistic fluid dynamics to microscopic transport
models on a given space-time hypersurface was introduced in [3].
There, the code that generates individual events from the currents
obtained within fluid dynamics was employed for the first time.

* The physics content (basic equations, assumptions etc.) of ideal,
relativistic fluid dynamics is discussed in detail in [1-4], where
you can also find references to related work.
