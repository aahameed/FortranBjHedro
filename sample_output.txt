The sample run has been performed on a digital-500au workstation running
Digital Unix.

The sample output "hyper.dat" and "rhllewxx.dat" was obtained by
"bj_hydro.f" with the following "par.dat" file:
0.1 500
0.01
0.99
0.5
100.0 1.0
2
3
2.85



From "hyper.dat", evgen.f (with Nid=10 in the code) produced the output
"events.dat" using the following "evgen_par.dat" parameterfile:
104             ! id of particle to be enhanced
104             ! id of particle to be enhanced
104             ! id of particle to be enhanced
104             ! id of particle to be enhanced
104             ! id of particle to be enhanced
4d0             ! total rapidity gap
0d0             ! impact parameter
6d0             ! initial Radius
10		! # of events
80d0		! pt-bin, in MeV
0.08		! rt-bin, in units of R
0.12		! t-bin, in units of R
